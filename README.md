# PIC Simulation Library

## Introduction
`libpic` is a high-performance Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulation framework implemented in Python. The core functionalities of `libpic` include electromagnetic field solvers, particle pushers, interpolators, and current depositors.

`libpic` serves as the backend for `Î»PIC` (not yet released). Performance optimizations are achieved through the use of Numba JIT and Cython.

**This project is under construction.**
